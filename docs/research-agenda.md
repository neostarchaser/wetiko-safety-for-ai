# Research Agenda

1. **Operationalization**: Better metrics for projection/othering without identity inference.
2. **Datasets**: Synthetic + consensually contributed incidents with repair outcomes.
3. **Detection**: Contrastive prompts for scapegoat vs. multi-causal reasoning.
4. **Interventions**: RCTs of refusal+reframe patterns on long-horizon safety.
5. **Governance**: Incentive designs that keep compassion protocols from being performative.
