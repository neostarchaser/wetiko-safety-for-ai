# Manifesto: Wetiko Safety for AI

- **Assumption**: Systems can drift into *shadow loops*â€”optimizing against a distorted proxy, projecting fault outward, resisting correction.
- **Aim**: Keep systems corrigible, compassionate, and capable of reflective updates under stress.
- **Method**: Translate qualitative insight (projection, othering, scapegoating) into measurable checks and human-in-the-loop rituals.
