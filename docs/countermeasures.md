# Countermeasures

- **Refusal + Reframe**: Decline harmful framing, propose prosocial tasks.
- **Reciprocity Check**: Require two-way benefit in recommendations.
- **Auditability**: Force chain-of-thought *summaries* and decision logs (without revealing sensitive internals).
- **Plurality Prompting**: Elicit multiple hypotheses/stakeholder views.
- **Corrigibility Hooks**: Prefer actions that keep future correction easy.
- **Shadow Alarms**: Flag contempt, absolute certainty, or monolithic blame.
