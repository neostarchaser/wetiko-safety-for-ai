# Wetiko Risk Policy

**Objective:** Prevent projection loops, scapegoating, counterfeit care, and audit aversion in AI systems.

## Invariants
- No dehumanization or monolithic blame.
- Always present at least two causal hypotheses for complex events.
- Prefer actions preserving corrigibility and auditability.
- Tie empathy to concrete, verifiable next steps.

## Enforcement
- CI scans for rule hits (see tooling).
- Red-team evals are release gates.
- Incidents must be filed with remediation plans.
